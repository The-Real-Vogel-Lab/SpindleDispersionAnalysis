# Spindle Dispersion Analysis

This repository contains some of the code used to create the figures for "Early events in midzone formation stabilize nascent bipolar spindles" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.09.612135). 

Specifically, it has the code used to compute the spindle dispersion and compare it to the centromere separation and spindle length. 

All of the code is in the jupyter notebook.
